This is a community driven list of everything valuable and interesting in the Touhou Community.

Touhou is among the biggest and oldest communities in the internet, spanning multiple languages and subcultures, you can find just about everything and this is very intimidating to newcomers and veterans alike. Touhou History is vast and that makes it hard to navigate, but not anymore!

Our goal is curating the best of the best The Community has made, with the idea to facilitate discoverability, archival/historical efforts and make community contact between different parts of the fandom easier.

We really value your help, without it, this project would wither away very quickly. If you are interested in helping this project or knowing more about it, please check out the list's original form in this [Github Repository](https://github.com/Raxelgrande/awesome-touhou).
